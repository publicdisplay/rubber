* better error handling instead of just a stack trace, e.g. when alias doesn't exist
* add version selector to gem/package installs
* add configuring/selection of ec2 security groups on host/role basis
* make install_packages/gems more intelligent (i.e. instead of running
install multiple times, calculate package list by combining role/host
configs together)
* make install_packages/gems run in parallel (need to patch capistrano...?)
* try to do less stuff as root
* do development rubber:config into tmp dir rather than requiring it be run as root?
* extract ec2 specific code, and ubuntu specific code into a strategy/factory pattern so this can be used with other grid computing system
* also have strategy/factory for dns updates (nettica vs dyndns/generic url post)
* figure out how to test the capistrano bits
* add s3 backups
* move serial_task into rubber namespace
* do something more intelligent with hosts in .etc.hosts, and clean them up on instance remove
* don't use /etc/hosts when checking if ip same for dyndns - maybe we should move dyndns setting to instances?
* divorce from rails for use in deploying other things
* add a rubber:build_image so bootstraps can be quicker once setup is locked down
