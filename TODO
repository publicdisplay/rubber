* add env config var for db config file (mysql.cnf) for bootstrap
* better error handling instead of just a stack trace, e.g. when alias doesn't exist
* add version selector to gem/package installs
* add configuring/selection of ec2 security groups on host/role basis
* make install_packages/gems more intelligent (i.e. instead of running
install multiple times, calculate package list by combining role/host
configs together)
* make install_packages/gems run in parallel (need to patch capistrano...?)
* talk about, or try to do less stuff as root
* do development rubber:config into tmp dir rather than requiring it be run as root?
* extract ec2 specific code, and ubuntu specific code into a startegy/factory patten so this can be used with other grid computing system
